--== Version ==--

I'd like to keep this called XI View, because most everyone from the windower community knows it as that.With that, I will start
it as XI View 2.0

--== DESCRIPTION ==--

XI View 2.0 is the continued work on the project to update FFXIs GUI to look cleaner and for status icons to be easier to understand at a glance, this was formerly known as Brandson's UI,FFXI Style or XI View from Darkshade.

XI View 2.0 includes updated Status Icons, Fonts, Graphic User Interface and Menu Skins for both normal 4:3 displays and wide screen 16:9/16:10 displays. 

--== INSTALLATION ==--

To install XI View download then extract the archive and then choose the folder pertaining to your monitor resolution (normal screen or wide screen) and then copy the ROM folder to your FFXI directory choosing yes when prompted to overwrite any files. 

The FFXI directory is usually located at X:\Program Files\PlayOnline\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XI\ or in x64 OS, X:\Program Files (x86)\PlayOnline\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XI\ X in place of your drive label. (Usually C)

The Steam version of FINAL FANTASY XI is located at X:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\ffxi\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XI and X:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ffxi\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XI

Special thanks goes to Darkshade for the original XI View and what he's done over the last year. Kactuar, for fixing the Icon changer program to accept the new 32x32 Icons.
And Deathbringer for the ability to change the ingame fonts and cursors.

Also, thanks Shinobi and Chef James with your help and creating new custom icons!

Thanks to Kenshi for allowing me to include his Master UI in the project.

Thanks to Wildman for his assistance and allowing me to include his files in the project also.

Thanks to all who previously worked on the project.
