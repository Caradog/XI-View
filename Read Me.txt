--== Version ==--
I'd like to keep this called XI View, because most everyone from the windower community knows it as that.With that, I will start
it as XI View 2.0

--== DESCRIPTION ==--
XI View 2.0 is the continued work on the project to update FFXIs GUI to look cleaner and for status icons to be easier to understand at a glance, this was formerly known as Brandson's UI,FFXI Style or XI View from Darkshade.

XI View 2.0 includes updated Status Icons, Fonts, Graphic User Interface and Menu Skins for both normal 4:3 displays and wide screen 16:9/16:10 displays. 

--== INSTALLATION ==--
To install XI View download then extract the archive and then choose the folder pertaining to your monitor resolution (normal screen or wide screen) and then copy the ROM folder to your FFXI directory choosing yes when prompted to overwrite any files. 
The FFXI directory is *usually located at X:\Program Files\PlayOnline\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XI\ or in x64 OS, X:\Program Files (x86)\PlayOnline\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XI\ X in place of your drive label. (Usually C)
